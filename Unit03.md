**Unit 3: Fourier Methods** <span id="3"></span> 
*The matrix transformation DFT introduced in Unit 2 is a discrete
version of the Fourier series to be studied in this unit.  The theory of
Fourier series is very rich.  For example, partial sums of the Fourier
series are orthogonal projection of the function it represents to the
corresponding subspaces of trigonometric polynomials.  In addition,
these partial sums can be formulated as convolution of the function with
the “Dirichlet kernels.”  Since averaging of the Dirichlet kernels
yields the “Fejer kernels” that constitute a positive “approximate
identity,” it follows that convergence, in the mean-square sense, of the
sequence of trigonometric polynomials, resulting from convolution of the
function with the Fejer kernels, to the function itself is assured. 
Consequently, being orthogonal projections, the partial sums of the
Fourier series also converge to the function represented by the Fourier
series, again in the mean-square sense.  This introduces the concept of
completeness, which is shown to be equivalent to Parseval’s identity,
with such interesting applications as solving the famous the Basel
problem.  This unit explores examples of the extension of the original
Basel problem from powers of 2 to powers of 4 and to powers of 6.  The
completeness property of Fourier series will be applied to solving
boundary value problems of PDE in Unit 5.*

**Unit3 Learning Outcomes**  
Upon successful completion of this unit, the student will be able to:  
-   Compute Fourier coefficients.
-   Compute Fourier cosine series.
-   Compute mean-square error of approximation by partial sums of
    Fourier series.
-   Solve the Basel problem and its extension by using functions
    different from the examples given in this unit.
