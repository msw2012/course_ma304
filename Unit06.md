**Unit 6: Wavelet Methods** <span id="6"></span> 
*This final unit is concerned with the study of multi-scale data
analysis.  This unit will introduce you to the notions of
multiresolution analysis (MRA) and wavelet transform (WT) as well as the
associated wavelet decomposition and reconstruction algorithms.  The WT
of a finite Fourier series is discussed to introduce the relationship
between scale and frequency, in particular with a group of frequencies,
called a frequency band.  We will also derive the inversion formula for
recovering the function from its WT.*  *The MRA architecture is
demonstrated by using B-spline functions.*  *Construction of wavelets by
appealing to the MRA is achieved by matrix extension.  To reduce the
computational complexity of the wavelet decomposition and reconstruction
algorithms, you will also study lifting schemes.* * To extend to the
wavelet transform of functions of two variables, we use tensor-products
of the wavelets with the corresponding scaling functions of the MRA.
 This unit ends with embedding a digital image in the wavelet-domain for
image manipulation, such as progressive transmission, image edge
extraction, and image enhancement.*

**Unit6 Learning Outcomes**  
Upon successful completion of this unit, the student will be able to:  
-   Give the relationship between scale and frequency for a given
    wavelet filter.
-   Perform matrix extension to compute wavelet filters.
-   Compute multi-scale data representation by applying the wavelet
    decomposition algorithm for the Haar wavelet.
-   Identify the order of vanishing moments of a given wavelet.
